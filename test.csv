"Seth Polyniak,

As part of your application to Entry Level Back End Developer: 2021, we recently invited you to complete our Coding Assessment.

We wanted to let you know that your responses have been received and are being considered, along with other information from your application process, to determine next steps. These next steps may include being invited to complete another assessment or invitation to an interview.

Please note that if you did not just complete an assessment, this means that your responses were returned from a prior application to IBM and completion of the same assessment. As your assessment responses remain valid for 12 months, there is no need to retake this assessment at this time.

IBM Assessment Team"
