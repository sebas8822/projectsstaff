"What's happening
We've enhanced our security requirements to better protect your accounts and personal information. As a result, you'll need to create a new, stronger password to access your accounts online.

You can disregard this email if you've changed your password within the last few days.

What you should know
We'll briefly interrupt your online banking experience in the near future to ask you to change your password. You can avoid this interruption and enhance your security by changing your password now.

What you need to do
Create a new password after you sign on. There are two ways to do this:

    On your computer, go to Security & Support in the main menu, then select Change Password.
    On your mobile device, go to Menu, tap your name or the profile icon, then tap Password.

What to do if you sign on with your fingerprint or face
This sign-on feature for the mobile app will be disabled after you change your password. You can set up this feature again after you sign on with your username and new password.

Questions?
We're here to help if you have any questions about changing your password. Please call us at 1-800-956-4442.

" Starting March 17, 2021, eBay will no longer offer sellers the option to change their invoiced currency to non-US currency on their eBay invoices. If you are currently receiving eBay invoices in a currency other than US dollars, you will continue to receive your invoices in your selected currency. Beginning March 17, you will only be able to change your non-US currency to US dollars. We are making this change to create a streamlined user experience for seller disbursements and charges when you join managed payments.

Most US sellers are already billed in US dollars. The change will affect a small percentage of sellers who currently use foreign currencies on their eBay invoices.

Thank you for selling on eBay,

"Hi Seth,

I want to make finding a great remote opportunity easier by sending you jobs that could match your skills and experience.

Hope this one offers you the flexibility you need to thrive: Mobile Engineer.

If this isn’t the right opportunity for you, perhaps you know someone else that may be interested?

Either way, I hope I can still be a resource for you down the line. Wishing you all the best!

Thanks,
