"Hi ,

Your print job is done. You print a lot, which is awesome

That also means you have kept The Detective pretty busy and now your Detective Hours (what is it?) have run out. The Detective is no longer watching your prints, and you won't get alerted even if your prints start to fail.

Everything else remains the same. You can still start, pause, or cancel your prints. Your webcam feed will stream as usual too.

There are several ways to get more Detective Hours:

    Earn Detective Hours by helping The Detective get better at her job.
    Buy Pre-paid Detective Hour Pack.
    Upgrade to the Pro plan. You get 50, instead of 10, free Detective Hours a month with the Pro plan. Also you can add Subscribe&Save Detective Hour Pack to your Pro plan at rates much lower than Pre-paid Packs.

"Hi Valued Client,

Retail investors have more information and more tools at their fingertips than ever before. 

But while charting tools, income statements and commission-free trading are empowering many, intermediaries continue to hold power over order execution and transparency, a structure that appears to tip the scales in favor of established investors.

Still, its not easy to understand how and when you might be putting your money at risk. 

Thats why Kraken Intelligence, our in-house research experts, has compiled a robust analysis of how markets are structured that examines both the issues inherent in traditional markets and how cryptocurrencies and digital assets level the playing field."
