"Hello Johan Sebastian ! 
 
Thank you for applying to become an Entry-Level Software Engineer at _nology, with training starting on May 29th, 2023. We are really excited to see your application hit our inbox! 

What happens now? 
_nology is on a mission to help more people launch a career in tech, regardless of their background, so we like to get in touch with applicants via an introductory phone call to hear a little more about what made you apply and what your situation is. Don’t worry, this is an informal chat and also gives you the opportunity to ask any burning questions. 
At this time, we’re experiencing an influx of applications, so whilst we always aim to chat with you within 4 weeks of applying. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through each application. 

Overview of our Application Stages 
We have three stages that assess skills in communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and aptitude to learn. Upon completion of each stage, a selection of applicants will be invited to progress to the next stage. We regularly check in to see how you are feeling and if you have any questions along the way. 
Here’s what to expect: 
1.	Learning & Logic Challenge – a short problem-solving quiz to complete online
2.	Video interview – a solo interview answering a series of questions, recorded online
3.	Group Assessment – a video call with group activities and tasks to complete together

Helpful info in the meantime 
New to coding? Or need a refresher? Watch this video for an overview of what coding is, and the types of programming languages you'll get to learn in our training too. You'll see that building a website or app requires many different elements and skills that are foundational to becoming a software engineer. 

We’ve attached our FAQs and the training curriculum for you to review too. 
We will be in touch soon! Best wishes,

"Hi Johan Sebastian,  

Thanks for you for applying to _nology and it’s great to hear you’re still so enthusiastic about the program. 

We noticed you have recently par-taken in the screening process with us here at _nology. We ask that if people are keen to re-apply, they wait 6 months before doing so, as to undergo the process again immediately is unlikely to have a significantly different outcome. 

It obviously requires a lot of time and effort from both your side and our side to go through these assessments, so we wouldn’t want to waste your time; and given the volume of applications we have come through, we need to be fair to everyone applying, and give others a chance to work through it for this intake. 

In terms of feedback, we score each part of the assessment process and tally the total scores once they’re all done, and unfortunately, you didn’t meet the pass criteria overall. 
Hopefully that gives you a clearer picture, and definitely do please reach out to us again towards the middle of next year if you’re still keen to! 

Thanks,  
the _nology team

"Hi Valued Client,

Retail investors have more information and more tools at their fingertips than ever before. 

But while charting tools, income statements and commission-free trading are empowering many, intermediaries continue to hold power over order execution and transparency, a structure that appears to tip the scales in favor of established investors.

Still, its not easy to understand how and when you might be putting your money at risk. 

Thats why Kraken Intelligence, our in-house research experts, has compiled a robust analysis of how markets are structured that examines both the issues inherent in traditional markets and how cryptocurrencies and digital assets level the playing field.
